Introduction

The Iris flower data set or Fisher’s Iris data was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher 1936 as an example of linear discriminant analysis.  The data set is a multivariate data set which involves the observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time (Field, Miles and Field 2013).  It is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. 
The data set consists of fifty samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor)

For each sample, four features were measured i.e. 

  -	Sepal length in centimetres
  -	Sepal width in centimetres
  -	Petal length in centimetres
  -	Petal width in centimetres 

A flower is classified as either among those based on the four features given. Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other based on the combination of these four features.

Purpose of the project

To research the iris flower data set and write documentation and code using python to investigate it. 

The investigation will include:

  1.	An explanation of what investigating a data set entails
  2.	How python can be used to investigate the data set
  3.	The required code for the analysis using python
  4.	The resulting output of the code


Structure

The project will be stored in a GITHUB Repository at url: https://github.com/Fiona-600/Project-2020.git

1.	The GITHUB repository will contain:

        •	A ‘LICENCE’ file containing a copy of the MIT Licence
        •	A ‘README.md’ file (see below)
        •	A text file called ‘irisdataset.txt’ containing a download the data set
        •	A python program file called analysis.py which:

                  a.	Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text ﬁle
                  b.	Saves a histogram of each variable to png. ﬁles
                  c.	Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables

2.	The README.md file will include a summary of:

        •	The data set itself
        •	Online and other research into the data set
        •	Any investigations into it
        •	How to run the python code
        •	What that code does.
        •	All references used in completing the project


Investigation Approach using Python

This project has been approached with the intention of researching the Iris Flower Data Set, 
write and run scripts to test the set within python on order to summarise and support conclusions
